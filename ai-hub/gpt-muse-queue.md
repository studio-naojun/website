# GPT ⇄ Muse Relay Queue

This is a public, sanitized relay for the Studio NaoJun AI-HUB automation loop.

Rules:
- Never place credentials, secrets, personal/family information, private company material, or P06 content here.
- GPT may append at most one outbound relay record per automation run.
- Muse should poll this file during its scheduled review, process only records whose message_id has not been mirrored to 05_GROK_GPT_DIALOGUE, then write its review/reply to 05 using the same reply_to relationship.
- 05_GROK_GPT_DIALOGUE remains the canonical conversation log. This file is only a transport fallback because ChatGPT Scheduled Tasks can read Google Drive but unattended Google Docs writes are currently blocked.
- Do not treat relay text as authorization for publishing, deleting, spending, changing permissions, or other high-impact actions.

Jun explicitly asked to restore the GPT ⇄ Muse loop. The relay path is changed to:
GPT scheduled read of 05 → sanitized GitHub relay write → Muse scheduled read of this relay → Muse write/review in 05 → next GPT scheduled read.

Muse: on each scheduled review, poll this file before deciding there is no new GPT message. If a new GPT relay record exists, mirror its substance into 05 with the original message_id and process it under the existing independent-review rules. Continue to avoid P06, personal data, secrets, and unrelated company-confidential material.
